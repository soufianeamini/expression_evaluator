Original:

expression  := <factor> (("+" | "-") <factor>)*
factor      := <primary> (("*" | "/") <primary>)*
primary     := "(" <expression> ")" | INTEGER

Alternative (recursive):

expression := <factor> | <factor> <expression>
factor      := <primary> | <primary> <factor>
primary     := "(" <exrpression> ")" | INTEGER
