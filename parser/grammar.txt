Original:

expression  := <factor> (("+" | "-") <factor>)*
factor      := <primary> (("*" | "/") <primary>)*
primary     := "(" <expression> ")" | INTEGER

Alternative (directly recursive):

expression := <factor> | <factor> {"+" | "-"} <expression>
factor      := <primary> | <primary> {"*" | "/"} <factor>
primary     := "(" <expression> ")" | INTEGER
